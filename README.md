1. DARK/LIGHT MODE TOGGLE FOR WIX STUDIO: I created this code to switch between dark and light mode on my portfolio website.

Set up:
For each section of your page, create two versions: dark and light mode. Make sure you ID each version clearly
Add the switch to the header. For the Header, I stacked two menu versions on tope of each other and create a background box to change the header's background color. The rest can be recolored in the code. 

Issues:
The toggle is not activated fully until the first click. So the first click doesn't switch to dark mode right away. But from the second click, everything works fine.
